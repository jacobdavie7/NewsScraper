# NewsScraper
Modifed version of a scraper made in class (not an assingmnet or for any credit) a while back to work with Python 3.8 (rather than 2.0) and added easy way to run on whatever site you want.

Used to pull the titles of news articals from a page with lots of news articals

Works by looking for HTML tags, speciicly headers. You will probally have to modify what tags it specify looks for depending on what site you want to pull data from. It was designed to run on https://dsu.edu/news/

When entering the URL you want to run it on, make sure you inlcude the full path with the "https://" and all that

Also, its good to note that you must have the requests module install on the machine you are running the script off of. 

Lastly, obviously, be aware of laws. Don't just run this wherever or try to run it to pull data from a page that is not public. I am not responsible for anything you do with this script. Don't be an idot.
